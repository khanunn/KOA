  <DialogTitle>k__BackingField: Invasion of the burning legion.
  <DialogDescription>k__BackingField:
  - In the heart of a realm shrouded in myth and legend, a new terror has emerged
    from the depths of ancient crypts and forgotten catacombs. Known as the Burning
    Skeletons, these spectral beings blaze with an infernal fire, their skeletal
    forms wreathed in flames that dance with malicious intent. Once guardians of
    peace in the realm, they have been twisted by dark sorcery into agents of chaos,
    their very existence threatening to engulf the land in an unrelenting conflagration.
  - Whispers of fear ripple through villages and towns as the Burning Skeletons multiply,
    leaving scorched earth and despair in their wake. Desperate cries for aid echo
    across the realm as brave adventurers are called upon to stand against this fiery
    scourge. Armed with courage and resolve, these heroes must venture forth into
    the unknown, confronting the Burning Skeletons and quelling the flames of terror
    before they consume everything in their path.
