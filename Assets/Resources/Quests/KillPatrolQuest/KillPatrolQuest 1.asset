  <DialogDescription>k__BackingField:
  - Amidst the rugged landscapes of a realm steeped in mystery, a new threat emerges
    from the depths of rocky crags and hidden caverns. Known only as the Rock Thrower
    Beasts, these formidable creatures possess a savage strength matched only by
    their relentless aggression. Towering over their surroundings, they hurl massive
    boulders with deadly accuracy, turning the very earth into a weapon against unwary
    travelers.
  - Whispers of danger spread like wildfire as tales of the Rock Thrower Beasts'
    ferocity echo through the land. Villages tremble at the distant rumble of falling
    stones, knowing that the beasts draw ever closer. In the face of this peril,
    brave souls are called upon to rise against the onslaught, their bravery the
    only barrier between civilization and the untamed wilderness. With every step
    into the unknown, these valiant adventurers must confront the Rock Thrower Beasts,
    their skill and cunning tested against the relentless barrage of stone and fury.
